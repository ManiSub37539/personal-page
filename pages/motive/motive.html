   <h1>My motive for learning web dev</h1> 
   <a href="../../index.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home</a>
   <p>Honestly, I think web dev is pretty useful and is a facet of the tech industry
    which is never truly going to be replaced by AI. At first, i thought web development
    was one of those fields which was super easy to learn and do and could easily be replaced
    by AI, but after browsing through reddit and surface level sifting through some discussions
    online I realized that it's probably not so easy, just because of the sheer amount of components
    and ever growing complexity involved in web development. Web development is not just about making web pages,
    It's about design, integrating interactive experiences, and even stretches as far as to incorporating 
    virtual machines and other crazy developments we see being integrated in browsers today. In short, we're always
    going to be coming up with ideas to go beyond the limitations of web browsers and what could go on in the web, so there'
    always going to be shit to learn.</p>
    
    <h2>This one response i saw on reddit about learning new habits</h2>
    <p>"the thing that world loves to tell us now is that we have to have a feeling of passion for something before we start doing it. That is simply not true. If you ask any of the masters in any art/skill, they will tell you that they have at some point hated the thing they're doing. They will also tell you that they kept doing it. So the answer to your question is this: There is no magic. There is no shortcut. You just have to pick something and go do it. Everyday. You do it today. You wake up tomorrow. You do it again. You did it yesterday. You do it again today. Day after day, year after year. That's how you get a "passion".
        Something that might help: Establish a routine for one thing you pick, anything. Do that thing every day for a month. It doesn't have to be long at first. Can be 15 mins, but do it every day, without fail. Then, increase the time you do, maybe to 20 mins. Do that for another month, and so on. You'll find, very quickly, that you're replacing your TV watching time with an activity of your choosing. You'll also find that you will have made a lot of progress in gaining skill for that activity. Good luck!"</p>
